// This is roots' version of the application file. You will have to
// manually load each stylsheet that you want to use here (this is a
// best practice anyway, gives you control over what's included and in
// what order). Just use an @import directive like is done below.

@import "roots"

// Uncomment only one of these - first one removes all default browser styles
// and the second is a port of normalize.css (http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)

// +global-reset
// +normalize

// If you uncomment this line, it will load roots styles on to default elements, much
// like a traditional css framework. If you don't want to replace everything, it can
// be broken down into many sub-mixins, which can be found in the file _roots.sass.
// It is *strongly recommended* to at very least use +base.

// +framework
